The quickly python package will become the successor of python-ly.

It is currently in the planning phase.

Like python-ly, it will provide tools to manipulate `LilyPond`_ music
documents, but instead of using the lexer in python-ly, which is very difficult
to maintain, it will use the new `parce`_ package for parsing LilyPond files.
