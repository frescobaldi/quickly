quickly
=======

The quickly python package will become the successor of python-ly.

It is currently in the planning phase.

Like python-ly, it will provide tools to manipulate LilyPond music documents,
but instead of using the lexer in python-ly, which is very difficult to
maintain, it will use the new parce package at https://parce.info for parsing
LilyPond files.
