"""
Some generic datatypes used by quickly.

Too small to justify separate modules but too generic to be added to some
module where they are actually used.

"""

class Properties:
    """A dictionary-like object that accesses keys as attributes.

    Adding another Properties object returns a new Properties instance
    with updated dict contents. Example::

        >>> from quickly.datatypes import Properties
        >>> p = Properties(repeat_count=3)
        >>> p
        <Properties repeat_count=3>
        >>> p.repeat_count
        3
        >>> p1 = Properties(unfold=True)
        >>> p + p1
        <Properties repeat_count=3 unfold=True>
        >>> del p.repeat_count
        >>> p
        <Properties>

    Accessing a non-existent property name returns None. Deleting a
    non-existent property does not raise an AttributeError. Setting an
    attribute to None does keep the attribute, and when adding the properties
    to another, the same property in the other will be overwritten by the newer
    one that was set to None.

    Use :func:`vars` to get a dictionary view on the properties. Use ``"key" in
    props`` to see whether an attribute is really present. An empty Properties
    object evaluates to False.
