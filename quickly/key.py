    The list has the same length as the :py:data:`scale <.pitch.MAJOR_SCALE>`

    never will have to be specified).

    The ``offset`` is an integer that specifies the number of notes to shift
    the scale to the left or right. The pitches in the scale from that offset
    are compared with the pitches from the beginning, and the returned
    alteration for that step is the difference from the default step in the
    scale. For example::

    accidentals that would be needed when transposing the scale starting at
    step 1 in the scale (that would be a dorian scale for the default major
    scale) to step 0 in the same scale, so this would be the accidentals that
