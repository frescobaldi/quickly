class Node(list):
    """Node implements a simple tree type, based on Python :class:`list`.

    You can inherit of Node and add your own attributes and methods.

    A node can have child nodes and a :attr:`parent`. The parent is referred to
    with a weak reference, so a node tree does not maintain circular
    references. (This also means that you need to keep a reference to a tree's
    root node, otherwise it will be garbage collected.)

    Adding nodes to a node sets the parent of the nodes; but removing nodes
    *doesn't* unset the parent of the removed nodes; and adding nodes does not
    automatically remove them from their previous parent; you should take care
    of that yourself (e.g. by using the :meth:`take` method).

    Iterating over a node yields the child nodes, just like the underlying
    Python list. Unlike Python's list, a node always evaluates to True, even if
    there are no children.

    To find the index of a node in its parent, use::

        >>> index = node.parent.index(node)

    This is safe, because it uses the nodes' identity, but potentially slow
    because it uses a linear search, so don't use it for every node in an
    iterative operation.

    Besides the usual methods, Node defines four special query operators:
    ``/``, ``//``, ``<<`` and ``^``. All these expect a Node (sub)class as
    argument, and iterate in different ways over selected Nodes:

    * The ``/`` operator iterates over the children that are instances of the
      specified class::

        for n in node / MyClass:
            # do_something with n, which is a child of node and
            # an an instance of MyClass

    * The ``//`` operator iterates over all descendants in document order::

        for n in node // MyClass:
            # n is a descendant of node and an instance of MyClass

    * The ``<<`` operator iterates over the ancestors::

        for n in node << Header:
            n.blabla    # n is the youngest ancestor that is a Header instance

    * The ``^`` operator iterates over the children that are *not* an instance
      of the specified class(es)::

        node[:] = (node ^ MyClass)
        # deletes all children that are an instance of MyClass

    Instead of one subclass, a tuple of more than one class may also be given.
