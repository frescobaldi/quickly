    Adding nodes to the list sets the parent of the nodes; and removing nodes
    sets the parent of the nodes to None; but adding nodes does not
    automatically remove them from the previous parent; you should take care of
    that yourself (e.g. by using the :meth:`take` method).

    Besides the usual methods, Node defines three special query operators:
    ``/``, ``//`` and ``<<``. All these expect a Node (sub)class as argument,
    and iterate in different ways over selected Nodes:

    * The ``/`` operator iterates over the children that are instances of the
      specified class::

        for n in node / MyClass:
            # do_something with n, which is a child of node and
            # an an instance of MyClass

    * The ``//`` operator iterates over all descendants in document order::

        for n in node // MyClass:
            # n is a descendant of node and an instance of MyClass

    * The ``<<`` operator iterates over the ancestors::

        for n in node << Header:
            n.blabla    # n is the youngest ancestor that is a Header instance
