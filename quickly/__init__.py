    If ``lexicon`` is True, the lexicon will be guessed based on filename and
    contents. If it is a string name, its name is looked up in the registry;

    The ``encoding``, if specified, is used to read the file; otherwise the
    encoding is autodetected. The ``errors`` and ``newline`` arguments will be
    passed to Python's :func:`open` function. Raises :class:`OSError` if the
    file can't be read.
