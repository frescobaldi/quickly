"""
The quickly.music module.

This module will provide a music object model that can be used for two things:

* building a LilyPond document (or expressions) from scratch
* representing a parsed LilyPond source document

*First* use case: Construct a music document or expression, optionally
manipulate it and then output it as a LilyPond source document (e.g. for
composition algorithms or import from other formats). It should be simple,
extensible and flexible.

The *second* use case is the most challenging: A LilyPond source document is
lexed by parce.lang.lilypond, and then transformed into a music Document
expression.

This expression is then used to manipulate and query the source document.
It should be possible to write modifications back to the source document, not
by bluntly replacing the full source document, but by accurately replacing
the modified parts.
