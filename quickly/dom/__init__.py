This module defines a DOM (Document Object Model) for LilyPond source files.

This LilyPond DOM is a simple tree structure where a command or environment
is represented by a node with possible child nodes.

Some LilyPond commands have their own node type, and the arguments are
represented by child nodes, while other commands use a generic Command node.

This DOM is used in two ways:

1. Building a LilyPond source document from scratch. This helps to create
   a LilyPond document, although it in no way forces the output to be a valid
   LilyPond file.

2. Transforming a *parce* tree of an existing LilyPond source document to a DOM
   document. All tokens are stored in the nodes (in the ``origin`` attributes),
   so it is possible to write back modifications to the original document
   without touching other parts of the document.

All nodes in this DOM inherit from the :class:`~element.Element` class.
