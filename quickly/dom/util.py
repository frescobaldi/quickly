    This is used to combine whitespace requirements. For example, newlines
    are preferred over single spaces, and a single space is preferred over
    an empty string. For example::

        >>> collapse_whitespace(['\n', ' '])
        '\n'
        >>> collapse_whitespace([' ', ''])
        ' '

def combine_text(fragments):
    r"""Concatenate text fragments collapsing whitespace before and after the
    fragments.

    ``fragments`` is an iterable of (``before``, ``text``, ``after``) tuples,
    where ``before`` and ``after`` are whitespace. If a ``text`` is empty, the
    whitespace before and after are collapsed into the other surrounding
    whitespace. Returns a tree-tuple (``before``, ``text``, ``after``)
    containing the first ``before`` value, the combined ``text``, and the last
    ``after`` value.
