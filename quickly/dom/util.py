def max_space(*whitespace):
    r"""Return the "most important" whitespace of the specified strings.

    This is used to combine whitespace requirements. For example, newlines
    are preferred over single spaces, and a single space is preferred over
    an empty string. For example::

        >>> max_space('\n', ' ')
        '\n'
        >>> max_space(' ', '')
        ' '

    """
