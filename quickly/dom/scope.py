    Initialize Scope with a parce Document. The

    helps finding included files. That url should be absolute.

    The ``parent`` is specified when a new Scope is created by
    :meth:`include_scope`.

    The ``factory`` keyword parameter and attribute is a callable that should
    return a :class:`parce.Document` for a filename. If you don't specify a
    factory, a default one is used that loads a Document from the file system,
    and if found, caches it using a cache based on the file's mtime.

    Specify a factory to use other caching, deferred loading, or to look for a
    document in a list of open documents in a GUI editor etc.

    If desired, add absolute urls to the :attr:`include_path` instance
    attribute, indicating folders where to search for includeable files.
