        """Returns 0 if this comment has at least three comment characters
        at the beginning.

        If it is on a line on its own, the current indent will then be ignored.

        head = self.write_head()[:3]
        if len(head) == 3 and len(set(head)) == 1:
            return 0


class MultilineComment(Comment):
    """Base class for a multiline comment element."""


class BackslashCommand(element.TextElement):
    r"""A command that starts with a backslash, like in LaTeX and LilyPond.

    The backslash (``\``) is not in the head value.

    """

        return text

    def write_head(self):
        """Add the backslash on write-out."""
        return '\\' + self.head


## Generic elements:

class Newline(element.Element):
    """A Newline.

    Not created from existing documents, but you can insert this node
    anywhere you want a newline in manually crafted documents.

    """
    head = ''

class BlankLine(element.Element):

    Not created from existing documents, but you can insert this node
    anywhere you want a blank line in manually crafted documents.

    """
    head = ''
    space_after = '\n\n'


class Line(element.Element):
    """Container that prints the child nodes on one line with a space in between.

    Not created from existing documents, but you can insert this node in a
    Document when you want some nodes to be on the same line, for example when
    you want to write a comment at the end of the preceding line instead of on
    a line of its own.

    """
    space_before = space_after = '\n'
    space_between = ' '


class Column(element.Element):
    """Container that prints every child node on a new line.

    Not created from existing documents, but you can insert this node in a
    Document when you want some nodes to be stacked vertically.

    """
    space_before = space_after = space_between = '\n'


class Text(element.TextElement):
    """Generic text that is printed unmodified."""


## Special element:

class Unknown(element.HeadElement):
    """Represents a document region that is not transformed.

    This element can only occur in documents transformed from source. It is
    used to denote reqions that are not transformed, such as CSS style tags or
    attributes, or script tags, in Html documents containing LilyPond music.

    *Parce* has fancy highlighting for those text fragments, but it makes no
    sense to try to transform those also to useful DOM nodes. So instead, we
    simply record the positions in the source document of these fragments using
    the first and the last token of such contexts that are not transformed.

    Calling :meth:`write_head` on this element results in an exception, because
    it does not know how it looks. But it knows the position in the document,
    because the first and the last untransformed tokens are in the origin.

    Before you can write out a document containing :class:`Unknown` elements
    fully out (e.g. using :meth:`~.element.Element.write` or
    :meth:`~.element.Element.write_indented`), you should replace those
    elements with e.g. :class:`Text` elements that have the text such as it
    appears in the source document. This can be done using
    :func:`.util.replace_unknown`.

    You *can* :meth:`~.element.Element.edit` documents with this element however,
    it will simply leave the unknown parts of the document as they are.

    """
    def write_head(self):
        """Raise RuntimeError."""
        raise RuntimeError(
            "can't write head value of Unknown element.\n"
            "Hint: replace Unknown with Text elements.")


## Language and Transform base/helper classes

class XmlLike:
    """Mixin class for a language definition that bases on parce.lang.Xml.

    Adds the comsume attribute to some lexicons, like comment and string, which
    makes transforming easier.

    Provides the :meth:`factory` method that creates the DOM node.

    """

        The ``head_origin`` and optionally ``tail_origin`` is an iterable of

        origin.

        return element_class.with_origin(tuple(head_origin), tuple(tail_origin), *children)


class AdHocTransform:

    This is used to create pieces (nodes) of a LilyPond document from text, and
    then use that pieces to compose a larger Document or to edit an existing
    document. It is undesirable that origin tokens then would mistakenly be
    used as if they originated from the document that's being edited.
