Base classes for the quickly.dom items.

An :class:`Item` describes an object and can have child objects. An Item can
display a ``head`` and optionally a ``tail``. The head is text that is printed
before the children (if any). The tail is displayed after the children, and
will in most cases be used as a closing delimiter.

An :class:Item can be constructed in two ways: either using the
:meth:from_origin class method from tokens (this is done by the
LilyPondTransform class), or manually using the normal constructor.

You can specify all child items in the constructor, so theoretically you
can build a whole document in one expression.

To get the textual output of an item and all its child items, use the
:meth:`~Item.output` method. TODO: indenting.

Whitespace is handled in a smart way: Item subclasses can specify the preferred
whitespace ``before``, ``after`` and ``between`` elements, and items that draw
head and tail texts can also specify the preperred whitespace after the head
and before the tail. When outputting the text, the whitespace between items is
combined to fulfil all requirements but to prevent double spaces.

When an Item is constructed from tokens using the :meth:`~Item.with_origin`
constructor, it is able to write ifself back in the document if modified, using
the :meth:`~Item.edit_head` and :meth:`~Item.edit_tail` method.
