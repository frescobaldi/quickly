(Abstract) base classes for the quickly.dom items.

The Item classes you can choose from are in the items module.

TODO
====

- distinguish between Items that originate from tokens from a document
  and Items that originate from ad-hoc created tokens,

  e.g. transform_text(LilyPond.root, "<c' d e>")

  Ad hoc tokens must not have the origin set, while tokens from a document
  have.

======
thinkin....

an Item:

- has some value
- that can originate from tokens origin (read)
- that can be set manually
- that must also be output (write)

how do we know if the value was altered manually?
- a "modified" flag
- compute the value each time from the origin?

When writing a new document:
- write out from the value

When writing back to an existing document:
- if the value has changed, replace the origins's slice with the new output
- if the value has not changed, do nothing

Whitespace handling...

and indenting...

where is what whitespace determined?....

no whitespace.

Simultaneous

whitespace around the notes
We could do:
  Simultaneous draws a space between the children


a full document: how many newlines between stuff?
- at minimum one
- certainly a newline after a single line comment
- in most cases two.


Maybe we should invent a Newline item, also capture Newline tokens?

Or should we make the automatic formatting so robust that it is never
needed to insert line breaks automatically?


It becomes clear that we want to know what whitespace to put
*after* what node.

A node can say that itself.

But is a node's last child is a singleline comment, that newline should
be honoured. So a newline wins over a regular space.

And, a node itself can specify what to put between the children
and before its tail. This should still consult wat each node wants.

Maybe:

    Item.after

    attribute containing the whitespace to draw after this item.
    (either '', ' ', or '\n')

    By default, this consults the last child and its own class-level preference.

SO:

an item itself has a preference for whitespace between its children
an item can have a preference for whitespace to draw after a certain Item type
an item has a preference for whitespace drawn after it


item.whitespace_after(childitem)

Document will return '\n\n' for most types but '\n' for comment


Item.after  (whitespace to draw after this item)
Item.between (whitespace to draw between child items)

Item.whitespace(item):



after       # minimum wsp to draw after
before      # minimum wsp to draw before item
between     # minimum wsp to draw between child items

def concat(self, item, next_item):
    return max_spacing(item.after, next_item.before, self.between)
