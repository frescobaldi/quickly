(Abstract) base classes for the quickly.dom items.

The Item classes you can choose from are in the items module.

TODO
====

- distinguish between Items that originate from tokens from a document
  and Items that originate from ad-hoc created tokens,

  e.g. transform_text(LilyPond.root, "<c' d e>")

  Ad hoc tokens must not have the origin set, while tokens from a document
  have.

======
thinkin....

an Item:

- has some value
- that can originate from tokens origin (read)
- that can be set manually
- that must also be output (write)

how do we know if the value was altered manually?
- a "modified" flag
- compute the value each time from the origin?

When writing a new document:
- write out from the value

When writing back to an existing document:
- if the value has changed, replace the origins's slice with the new output
- if the value has not changed, do nothing
