Elements needed for Latex documents.

.. note::

   This module does not create DOM nodes for all Latex content.

   You can build a full Latex document from scratch using the available nodes,
   but parce supports much more syntax than makes sense to build DOM nodes for.

LilyPond music is always in a lily.Document nodes, and can occur in a braced
command or an environment.
