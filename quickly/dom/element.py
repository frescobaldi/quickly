"""
This module defines the :class:`Element` class.

An Element describes an object and can have child objects. An Element can
display a ``head`` and optionally a ``tail``. The head is text that is printed
before the children (if any). The tail is displayed after the children, and
will in most cases be used as a closing delimiter.

An Element can be constructed in two ways: either using the
:meth:`~Element.from_origin` class method from tokens (this is done by the
LilyPondTransform class), or manually using the normal constructor.

You can specify all child elements in the constructor, so theoretically you can
build a whole document in one expression.

To get the textual output of an element and all its child elements, use the
:meth:`~Element.write` method. Indented output is created by the
:meth:`~Element.write_indented` method.

Whitespace is handled in a smart way: Element subclasses can specify the
preferred whitespace before, after and between elements, and elements that have
head and tail texts can also specify the preperred whitespace after the head
and before the tail. When outputting the text, the whitespace between elements
is combined to fulfil all requirements but to prevent double spaces.

When an Element is constructed from tokens using the
:meth:`~Element.with_origin` constructor, it is able to write ifself back in
the document if modified, using the :meth:`~Element.edit` method.

:class:`Element` inherits from  :class:`~quickly.node.Node`, and thus from
:class:`list`, to build a reliable and easy to navigate tree structure.
